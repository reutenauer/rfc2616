RFC 2616
========

Navigable version of the RFC 2616 text.

This used to be available in incomplete form at http://www.rfc2616.com
but has now been retired.  It stopped abruptly after the beginning of
section 7, and maybe that was why it was taken down.  I retrieved the
file from archive.org and registered rfc2616.org with a view to complete
the process, because I think it was a useful thing.  The navigation is
pretty well done and the style is nice.
